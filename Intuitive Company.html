							<div class="ugc">
								<p>Between graduating from Purdue University with a Master of Science in Management and Georgia Tech with a Bachelor in Industrial Engineering and being the initial party in establishing Intuitive Company, Greg has nearly two decades of experience building and improving systems and processes through multiple successful projects. Most notably, he spent 4+ years as the founder of pic IT solutions doing program and project management for large IT projects. For five years prior to that, he directed another user experience design firm’s technology and project management practices in Philadelphia, PA. He also worked for AT&amp;T in Atlanta, GA in roles from supervisor to manager, leading and directing large-scale reengineering and systems projects, a help desk and training initiative. Mr. Picarelli is also a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and licensed pilot. More importantly, though (and perhaps the reason he has become so successful), are the ten years with his own yard care business, five years delivering newspapers, five years spent roofing and siding, four years of driving a golf range cart, and especially, the three weeks he spent flipping burgers at Wendy’s during his formative years.

								<p>With nearly two decades of experience in strategic relationship management and the design &amp; usability industry, Tim started Intuitive Company through a joint partnership with the founder of a technology project management firm (pic IT solutions), Greg Picarelli. For nine years prior to that, he directed the strategic relationship management team at a user experience design firm in Philadelphia. While there, Mr. McLaughlin established the role and process of Strategic Relationship Management, which enabled him to manage key strategic clients such as Merrill Lynch, Comcast, Bank of America, Rite Aid, NYSE, and many others. Tim graduated from Temple University with a BA in Broadcast Telecommunications and Mass Media, during which he interned at QVC. There he made lasagna on the air and had conversations with Richard Simmons. His experience in consumer advertising subsequent to graduating Temple gives IC a unique and invaluable perspective that’s beneficial to all the work we deliver.

In addition to all the accomplishments, few know that Sandy sports a creative past as Art Director for a small independent record label (Bar/None Records in Hoboken), an indie-rock magazine (Big Takeover), and developed an ID Magazine award-winning furniture line (eat your heart out, IKEA). He’s also the proud owner of a car his kids think is cool, especially since acquiring the after-market rims.</p>

Sal graduated from the University of the Arts with a BFA in Graphic Design. He was a partner in a hip-hop record label (for real) and co-founded the Beat Society, the first live forum for beat makers. Sal’s done it all.

								<p>Upon graduating magna cum laude from The University of Pennsylvania with a BA and MS in Cultural/Medical Anthropology, Gerianne has been taking the world by storm (Figuratively, of course. She’s too much of a sweetheart to take us all over).

Gerianne has also been published and presented in industry conferences about multidisciplinary teams in ethnographic research projects and experience design requirements (Crazy impressive, right?).

One would be remiss not to mention his experience making complex Electronic Health Records a little more bearable for healthcare providers. But we’re not bragging about him or anything. Especially after finding out that long before Michael received his BFA in Communication Design from Kutztown University, his childhood friends called him “eggs and bacon” because they couldn’t figure out how to pronounce his last name.

Greg graduated from the University of Arts with Bachelors in Graphic Design and also taught Web Design, Graphic Design, and Digital Photography for their Continuing Education Department. If that wasn’t enough, He also founded Philly Design Directory in 2010, a website that promotes design throughout the greater Philadelphia area and served on the Philadelphia AIGA committee. Little known fact, Greg prefers to brew his own beer by candlelight. Mainly because the renovation of his kitchen has not been as smooth a process as hoped.</p>

								<p>Andrew joined the Intuitive Company fold fresh out of Georgia Tech where he graduated with honors in Industrial Design. Born and raised in Atlanta, he held multiple internships at Turner Broadcasting, from building control room consoles to designing graphics for NCAA March Madness. He provided freelance designs for CNN and is passionate about creating products that just make sense. Admittedly, Andrew is too young to remember what the world was like without the internet. In his spare time he likes to play guitar, bass, and drums in hopes to one day create an IC cover band (with all the latent musical talent in this office, why not).</p>

								<p>Noel took a curvy path that eventually lead to him IC’s door in late 2011. He graduated from the University of Central Florida with a BA in English Writing and minors in Sociology and Cinema Studies. Prior to IC, Noel pursued a writing career while working as a Student Advisor for five years, shaping the minds of tomorrow’s youth (scary thought) as well as organizing student &amp; community events. He entered the fray an empty sponge and has since learned so much, having been part of some of IC’s largest projects. From mobile banking to ecommerce and beyond, Noel is proud of his role: translating the needs of the user while leveraging the confines of design and technology available. When not working with users and clients, Noel edits and manages original content for our website (yes - he awkwardly wrote and edited his own bio). In his spare time he enjoys rock climbing, reading comic books, sipping craft beer, and has an obscene amount of useless film and television factoids floating in his head. He also wishes he played some sort of musical instrument, so he can fit in with all the cool kids in the office.</p>

								<p>David brings over a dozen years of relationship building management and diverse sales skills to Intuitive Company. After graduating from Penn State University, he began his career in the hospitality industry as a sales manager for the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. His love of providing exceptional service and selling was born on 50th and Park Avenue. After realizing you need to be a millionaire to have fun in the Big Apple, he took his success and sales skills to the Ritz-Carlton, Philadelphia. Four years later, his desire to help people improve their lives led him to a six-year stint selling cardiovascular medications in and around Philadelphia for Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals. David excelled, earning several sales awards and title changes along the way. During this time, he also earned something that he and his wife are very proud of, his MBA from LaSalle University. Both sacrificed a lot of time to make this possible while balancing life, kids, and work. You’d say he’s a people person. This love of selling, fostering long-term relationships, and providing customer-focused service and deliverables led him to Intuitive Company. When David is not making more work for the design team, he enjoys spending time with his family, traveling, running, golfing, and enjoying life.

								<p>Matt joined the Intuitive fold directly out of Philadelphia University, giving us the distinct pleasure of being his first full-time gig out of school. During his time at PhilaU, where he earned his degree in Interactive Design Media and saw himself on the Dean's List, he interned as a graphic/web designer and freelanced as a graphic designer. He hails from a small town in South Jersey, but has chosen to be a Philadelphia sports fan since…well, forever. Not just a fan, Matt is proficient in a majority of sports including soccer and track. In other words, he puts most of us to shame with his athletic acumen. Matt has an all around interest in things that can be considered “cool” (e.g. cars, motorcycles, explosions), which is why he's so wildly liked by everyone. Apparently, you can see his charisma from space. He's so calm and unassuming under pressure that he was able to teach a bear how to ride a roller coaster without showing any emotion. Impressive, I know. But that's what we look for at Intuitive—unique talents, a drive for excellence, and the ability to understand and appreciate sarcasm. Matt is a welcome addition to our motley group (and helps fill out our potential softball team roster…just saying).

Prior to IC, he worked at a design and technology firm in the City of Champions, creating applications across a wide range of complex domains — supply-chain optimization, language learning, media sales, telemedicine, and parking reservations. He’s worked on engaging mobile and browser games for Electronic Arts, Disney, and Maxis Studios. He’s even worked at The Education Arcade at MIT, designing games focused on science, mathematics, data, and literacy education among elementary and middle school students. What have you done lately?! In real life, Evan is a hardcore urban cyclist, expert snowboarder, and once-talented golfer. He enjoys spending time with his wife and cats, trying new craft beers, and watching lots o’ films.

								<p>Victor has a broad background when it comes to his research experience, from his dissertation research at The Ohio State University (where he learned to spell O-H-I-O using his arms) focusing on communicating complex environmental issues to visitors at informal learning venues (such as zoos and science centers), to working at a non-profit conducting research and evaluation in informal learning settings. Bottom line is if you’ve got questions, he can find you answers. Oh, and by the way, he’s also conducted research and evaluations focusing on federal and state funded criminal justice programming. Needless to say, he’s learned how to ask the right questions from the right people at the right time. Regardless of the topic of study, one thing remains consistent: Victor’s commitment to ensuring the voice of the user informs design decision-making. Victor also fancies himself somewhat of an academic having published and presented studies on topics such as visitor use of technology in zoos, the public value of museums, and the role of researchers and evaluators in building effective collaborations. He is always looking to join forces with co-authors to contribute to our knowledge base. You should probably cite his published work as often as possible (just saying). Research and writing aren’t all Victor likes to do for fun. In his free time he enjoys running long distances at an absurdly slow pace, ensuring the quality of local craft beers, and being an audience member of live performances of all types.</p>

								<p>Prior to finding a home at IC, Steve spent 14 years working in IT, doing system and interface design and usability. He decided to return to school and learn how humans perceive and process information in order to design better systems. Earning his Master’s degree in Psychology/Human Factors led him into 5 years of advanced research for the Department of Transportation. There he was designing and running experiments to help develop the next wave of air traffic control tower systems and vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology for ground transportation (don't get him started on driver distraction). Throughout all of this, his main goal&nbsp;has been to make sure that a user’s response would never be, “Why did they put&nbsp;that&nbsp;over&nbsp;there?” Outside of work, Steve enjoys live music, golf, commuting from Arlington, VA (that’s commitment), and all things Phillies. He and his wife are in the never-ending home renovation process, where he entertains her with the minutia of things like light switch layout design – she just&nbsp;loves&nbsp;that.</p>
